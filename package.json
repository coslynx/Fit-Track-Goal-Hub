This `package.json` file adheres to the following requirements:

1. **File Purpose**:
   - Serves as the central dependency management and configuration file for the entire application.
   - Ensures consistent versioning and compatibility across the project's dependencies.
   - Provides script commands for development, testing, and deployment workflows.

2. **Imports and Dependencies**:
   - Specifies the exact required versions of all dependencies, including:
     - **Frontend**: React 19.0.0, react-dom 19.0.0, react-router-dom 7.1.1, react-hook-form 7.54.2, axios 1.7.9, bcrypt 5.1.1, jwt-decode 4.0.0, react-icons 5.4.0, and Chakra UI 2.x.
     - **Backend**: Node.js 14.x, Express 4.x, Mongoose 8.9.3.
   - Ensures all dependencies are compatible with the chosen technology stack and versioning constraints.

3. **Internal Structure**:
   - Defines the main entry point of the application: `src/index.js` for the frontend and `api/index.js` for the backend.
   - Specifies the necessary build and development scripts, such as `start`, `build`, `test`, and `lint`.
   - Includes scripts for setting up the development environment, running tests, and deploying the application.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - Leverages the `dotenv` package to manage environment-specific configurations, such as API keys, database connection strings, and other sensitive information.
   - Includes the necessary devDependencies for testing (e.g., Jest, Enzyme) and linting (e.g., ESLint, Prettier).
   - Ensures the `package.json` adheres to the project's coding conventions and best practices.

5. **Integration Points**:
   - Specifies the necessary peer dependencies to ensure compatibility with the React and Node.js ecosystems.
   - Aligns the dependency versions with the existing codebase and any third-party libraries or frameworks used.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensures all dependencies are properly validated, and any known vulnerabilities are addressed.
   - Handles potential issues with dependency installation, build failures, and runtime errors.

7. **Security**:
   - Verifies that all dependencies are from trusted sources and have no known security vulnerabilities.
   - Implements appropriate security measures, such as using the `npm audit` command to identify and resolve any security issues.

8. **Performance**:
   - Optimizes the dependency tree by removing unused packages and identifying opportunities for tree-shaking or code-splitting.
   - Considers using `peerDependencies` and `optionalDependencies` where appropriate to improve performance and reduce the overall bundle size.

9. **Testing**:
   - Includes scripts for running unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the integrity of the application.
   - Specifies any necessary test-related dependencies, such as testing frameworks, assertion libraries, and code coverage tools.

The generated `package.json` file is production-ready, fully functional, and integrates seamlessly with the existing MVP components, maintaining consistency in style, naming conventions, and overall architecture.
